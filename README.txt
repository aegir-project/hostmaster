The Aegir system
================

This install profile is part of the front end of the Aegir hosting
system that also consists of the hosting framework (front end) and the
provisioning framework (backend).

The front end and back end are designed to be run separately, and each
front end will also be able to drive multiple back ends.

The most up to date information regarding the project and its goal
can be found in the Aegir wiki page:

To install the complete Aegir system, you first need to install Drush
and Provision, see the install instructions provided in the Provision
module.
