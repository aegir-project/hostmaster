Aegir 0.2 installation instructions
===================================

This document describes briefly how to install a multi-platform,
single-server Aegir Drupal provisionning system. Those instructions
limit themselves to getting you into the Aegir wizard, which will then
give you further configuration instructions.

This document assumes the Aegir home is in /var/aegir, adapt as desired,
but make sure that the user you create (as suggested in the install
wizard) has this directory configured as its home directory.

Checking out the code
---------------------

This assumes you have installed CVS and have access to the /var
directory. This may require running those steps as root.

Shell commands::
 cd /var
 cvs -z6 -d:pserver:anonymous:anonymous@cvs.drupal.org:/cvs/drupal co -d aegir/drupal-5.x -r DRUPAL-5-12 drupal
 cd aegir/drupal-5.x/
 cvs co -d profiles/hostmaster contributions/profiles/hostmaster
 cvs co -d sites/default/modules/hosting contributions/modules/hosting
 cd /var/aegir
 cvs co -d drush  contributions/modules/drush
 mkdir .drush
 cvs co -d .drush/provision  contributions/modules/provision

Apache configuration
--------------------

Those instructions assume you are running Debian specific and
installing aegir in http://aegir.example.com. If you are running
another system you basically need to:

 1. create a directory for Aegir configs
 2. activate the mod_rewrite engine
 3. include the Aegir apache configurations in Apache
 4. create a base configuration file for Aegir in /var/aegir/config/vhost.d/aegir.example.com
 5. restart apache

So this needs to be ran as root too.

Shell commands::
 cd /var/aegir
 mkdir -p config/vhost.d/
 a2enmod rewrite
 echo "Include /var/aegir/config/vhost.d/" > /etc/apache2/conf.d/aegir
 cp drupal-5.x/profiles/hostmaster/apache2.conf.txt config/vhost.d/aegir.example.com
 /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

Database configuration
----------------------

Here you want to make a basic database configuration for the Drupal
you are going to install. You want to run those commands using your
database 'root' user.

SQL commands::
 CREATE DATABASE aegir;
 GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, INDEX, ALTER, \
  CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES, LOCK TABLES ON aegir.* TO \
  'aegir'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'XXXXXXXX';

Install the Drupal
------------------

Now you are ready to install the first Drupal using this installation
profile. Point your browser to http://aegir.example.com/ , assuming
DNS is properly configured to point to your webserver, otherwise you
may want to try http://localhost/ .

The installer is going to complain about the permissions of
settings.php, just fix the permissions:

Shell commands::
 chmod a+w /var/aegir/drupal-5.x/sites/default/settings.php

Select the hostmaster install profile, enter the database credentials
you setup above and then the installer will prompt you to secure the
permissions on the settings.php file again:

Shell commands::
 chmod a-w /var/aegir/drupal-5.x/sites/default/settings.php

Follow the wizard
-----------------

You should now be in the installation wizard. The wizard is usually
self-documenting so you should just be able to follow the instructions
in the wizard to configure Aegir to properly use the webserver and
database server.

Installing new platforms
------------------------

To deploy new platforms to provisions site to, you simply need to
download the platform source code (which can be done with drush) and
then, on the hostmaster site, create a new Platform node which points
to where the source was downloaded.

Shell commands::
 cd /var/aegir
 ./drush/drush.php dl drupal

Use "drush dl drupal-5.x" to get the latest release of the 5.x branch.
