Aegir Upgrade Instructions
==========================

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This document describes briefly how to upgrade an existing Aegir installation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Conventions and tips
====================

All instructions and in general all commands must be run as aegir user,
so all permissions are always set correctly.

To become aegir user you can issue this command::

  su -s /bin/sh aegir

(Note you must run this as root or prefix with sudo).

Note that /bin/sh is an example. You may wish to instead use the shell
of your choice, i.e /bin/bash

Additionally to make following instructions generic and not dependant on
a concrete Drupal or Aegir version, we will use shell environment
variables. Since 0.4, the hostmaster platform is prepended with 'hostmaster'
so as not to clash with any other Drupal platforms. If you are upgrading from
Aegir version 0.3, your hostmaster platform may be called 'drupal-6.14'.

You should replace following command for current versions at the time
you are reading this document.

Shell commands::

  export AEGIR_TAG=HEAD
  export DRUPAL_DIR=/var/aegir/hostmaster-$AEGIR_TAG
  export OLD_DRUPAL_DIR=/var/aegir/drupal-6.14

This document also assumes drush is installed properly and we use an
environment variable to simplify the documentation again.

Shell commands::

  export DRUSH='php /var/aegir/drush/drush.php'

As of the 0.4-alpha3 release, 'unzip' is a required dependency on your 
server in order to successfully extract the jquery.ui library that is
part of some UI improvements. On Debian, this means:

Shell commands::

 apt-get install unzip

Finally, we use git to install some packages, so this needs to be
installed for upgrades. On Debian, this means:

Shell commands::

 apt-get install git-core

Generic upgrade instructions
============================

We aim to create a generic upgrade process that will be consistent
across versions. This section describes this process. However, there
are version-specific upgrade instructions that may be more relevant to
your installation in the next section.

Upgrading the backend
---------------------

In general, we try to keep the backend and the frontend compatible
with each other during release cycles. That is: provision 0.3 and
hosting 0.3 will always be able to talk to each other. hosting 0.2 was
able to talk to provision 0.3 too, but the API is not well enough
defined so that can be counted upon.

Therefore, you want to keep the frontend and the backend in sync. When
you do a major upgrade (e.g. 0.3 -> 0.4) of the backend, you *must*
upgrade the frontend soon after.

Bottomline: first you upgrade the backend, then the frontend.

Upgrading the backend is as simple as installing a new version of
Drush and Provision over the old ones. The below is an example of
downloading Drush. A new version of Drush may exist since the time
of this writing. You should replace the generic example given below
for the current version at the time you are reading this document.

Keep a copy of the old provision and drush in case something goes wrong 
in the frontend.

Shell commands::

  cd /var/aegir
  mv drush drush.bak
  wget http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/drush-$VERSION.tar.gz 
  tar -xvzf drush-$VERSION.tar.gz
  rm drush-$VERSION.tar.gz
  mv .drush/provision provision.bak
  $DRUSH dl provision --destination=.drush

Provision 0.4 has added a new dependency on drush_make, which will also
need to be installed to upgrade the front end.

Shell commands::

  $DRUSH dl drush_make --destination='/var/aegir/.drush'

Upgrading the frontend
----------------------

These are generic instructions to upgrade your hosting, hostmaster,
eldir or Drupal core installation to new versions. As of 0.4 this process
has largely been automated, and will be able to upgrade 0.3 and any of
the 0.4 development releases to the latest applicable versions.

Once you have upgraded the backend, and you have installed drush_make
you will need to run the hostmaster migrate command.


Shell commands::

  cd $OLD_DRUPAL_DIR
  $DRUSH hostmaster-migrate aegir.example.com $DRUPAL_DIR

The directory specified must be an absolute path to where you want
the new release to be stored. If the directory does not exist, provision
will use drush_make to fetch and assemble the correct version of the front
end for the specific release of the backend you are running.

This command will completely replace the crontab entry for the aegir user,
and asks for confirmation before it does so. If you do not confirm, the process
will be halted as it is necessary for the task queue to be processed.

The command above will fetch the latest stable Drupal release, so it can simply
be run again when a new security release of Drupal is made available.


Specific upgrade procedures
===========================

This section describes specific upgrade steps that must be taken
between certain point releases. If one of those section applies to
your installation, disregard the generic instructions and use those.

Upgrading the frontend from 0.2 (Drupal 5)
------------------------------------------

The major change between 0.3 and 0.2 is that 0.3 now targets the
Drupal 6 platform on the frontend (note the backend still supports
both Drupal 5 and 6).We also switch away from using the sites/default/
for Aegir in 0.3. So the upgrade procedure is basically the "Upgrading
the Drupal core safely" procedure detailed above, with some extra
steps.

Make sure you also checkout the install_profile_api module (>=2.1) as
it is a new dependency.

The first step is to import and verify the current aegir site
(sites/default) so it has a proper configuration. This needs to be
done because the default site was completely ignored by Aegir up until
now and needs to be transfered now.

In this case, the old drupal is a drupal 5:

Shell commands::

  export DRUPAL_DIR=/var/aegir/drupal-6.13
  export OLD_DRUPAL_DIR=/var/aegir/drupal-5.9

Note that this assumes you have already updated provision to a proper
version, see above.

Shell commands::

 cd /var/aegir
 $DRUSH dl drupal
 cd $DRUPAL_DIR
 cvs co -d profiles/hostmaster -r$AEGIR_TAG contributions/profiles/hostmaster
 mkdir profiles/hostmaster/modules
 $DRUSH dl --destination=./profiles/hostmaster/modules hosting install_profile_api
 $DRUSH dl --destination=./profiles/hostmaster/themes eldir 
 # also checkout any modules you may have enabled in the d5 platform
 # now you want to add the platform in the frontend (Create content -> platform) and wait for the task to be processed
 $DRUSH -r $OLD_DRUPAL_DIR provision verify
 $DRUSH -r $OLD_DRUPAL_DIR provision import default
 $DRUSH -r $OLD_DRUPAL_DIR provision verify default
 $DRUSH -r $OLD_DRUPAL_DIR provision backup default ~/default.tar.gz
 $DRUSH -r $DRUPAL_DIR provision verify
 $DRUSH -r $DRUPAL_DIR provision deploy d6.aegir.example.com ~/default.tar.gz
 # review changes, see if it works to your liking, when you're done:
 $DRUSH -r $DRUPAL_DIR provision delete d6.aegir.example.com
 crontab -e # disable the cronjob to avoid warnings
 $DRUSH -r $OLD_DRUPAL_DIR provision delete aegir.example.com
 # here you should really use the backup generated in the above step,
 # but the old backups also works, it's just not up to date
 $DRUSH -r $DRUPAL_DIR provision deploy aegir.example.com ~/default.tar.gz
 crontab -e # change root to new platform, make sure you have a --uri=aegir.example.com

Note that the import/verify of the 'default' site is required only
because that site is typically ignored in Aegir. This procedure will
migrate your main frontend away from that 'default' setup. See
http://drupal.org/node/453540 for details.

Upgrading Aegir from 0.1
------------------------

Note: to upgrade from 0.1 to 0.3, it is highly recommended that you
first upgrade to 0.2.

Upgrading hostmaster should be as simple as removing the provision and
drush modules from your profiles/hostmaster/modules directory. You
also need to create a new drush and provision checkout. Finally, you
can remove the drush.php symlink.

You will also need to update the hosting module and run update.php so
that new changes to the database are taken into account. This will
trigger platform verification and other cleanup tasks. Starting with
0.2, this process will be automated (see the above process).

Finally, you will need to put the path to that new drush in the
webserver node configuration. Rerunning the wizard will prompt you for
that. Make sure you also run the hosting setup command.

Those commands need to be ran as your "aegir" user.

Shell commands::

 export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous:anonymous@cvs.drupal.org:/cvs/drupal
 cd /var/aegir
 cvs co -d drush -rDRUPAL-6--2-1 contributions/modules/drush
 mkdir .drush
 cvs co -d .drush/provision -rDRUPAL-6--0-2 contributions/modules/provision
 rm drupal-5.x/drush.php
 rm -r drupal-5.x/profiles/hostmaster/modules/provision
 rm -r drupal-5.x/profiles/hostmaster/modules/drush
 cvs up -A drupal-5.x/profiles/hostmaster/modules/hosting
 # here run update.php on the site and setup your drush path
 cd drupal-5.x && php ../drush/drush.php hosting setup

Upgrading Hostslave platforms from 0.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Provision has been migrated out of the platforms. It used to be
installed in the profiles/hostslave/modules directory. It is now in
~/.drush/provision. So you can simply cleanup the hostslave profile
and the virtual host created for the hostslave profile. You can also
remove the drush symlink.

Shell commands::

 cd /var/aegir
 rm -r drupal-6.x/profiles/hostslave
 rm config/vhost.d/hostslave
 rm drupal-6.x/drush.php

You should also delete the database created during the hostslave
install:

SQL commands::

 DROP DATABASE hostslave;
